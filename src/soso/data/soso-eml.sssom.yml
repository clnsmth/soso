mapping_set_description: This mapping set is a manually curated alignment of the Science-on-Schema.org (SOSO) recommendations for datasets, with the Ecological Metadata Language (EML). Property alignment was created using the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM; https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/home/). The motivation of this mapping is to inform an automated transformation from EML to SOSO for use by data repositories to expose their holdings to data aggregators and search engines. A high degree of precision was attempted. Note, object identifiers in this SSSOM mapping are constructed from the EML namespace URI for the defined types and elements, following XQuery and RDF/XML in semantic web applications. However, these URIs do not resolve to web accessible resources, but do provide utility to developers converting EML to SOSO. Also note, because EML namespaces are not terminated in a slash or fragment (#), the fully expanded URIs are slightly less "human readable" than ideal (e.g. the URI for the "title" element is https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/resource-2.2.0title).
