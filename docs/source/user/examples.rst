Welcome to the Examples documentation! This documentation gives examples of using this package for various schemas.

SPASE
------------

This use case is for those wishing to convert SPASE (Space Physics Archive Search and Extract) metadata records into Science-On-Schema.Org markup. The newly converted schema.org JSON files created using this package are intended to be embedded within the associated SPASE record's landing page. This embedding helps improve SPASE's data discovery through search engines such as Google. This notebook (provide link to spase-HowToConvert.ipynb) walks you through this conversion process, step by step.
