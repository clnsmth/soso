For creating `Science On Schema.Org`_ (SOSO) markup in dataset landing pages to improve data discovery through search engines.

.. _Science On Schema.Org: https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org

-------------------

The primary function is to convert metadata records into SOSO markup. To perform a conversion, specify the file path of the metadata and the desired conversion strategy. Each metadata standard corresponds to a specific strategy.

    >>> from soso.main import convert
    >>> r = convert(file='metadata.xml', strategy='EML')
    >>> r
    '{"@context": {"@vocab": "https://schema.org/", "prov": "http://www. ...}'

Some SOSO properties may not be derived from metadata records alone. In such cases, additional information can be provided via `kwargs`, where keys match the property name, and values are the property value.

For example, the `url` property representing the landing page URL does not exist in an EML metadata record. But this information is known to the repository hosting the dataset.

    >>> kwargs = {'url': 'https://sample-data-repository.org/dataset/472032'}
    >>> r = convert(file='metadata.xml', strategy='EML', **kwargs)
    >>> r
    '{"@context": {"@vocab": "https://schema.org/", "prov": "http://www. ...}'

It's worth noting that this `kwargs` approach is not limited to supplying unmappable properties; it can be utilized to override any top-level SOSO property.

Unmappable properties are listed in the strategy documentation.
