For creating `Science On Schema.Org`_ (SOSO) markup in dataset landing pages to improve data discovery through search engines.

.. _Science On Schema.Org: https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org

-------------------

The primary function is to convert metadata records into SOSO markup. To perform a conversion, specify the file path of the metadata and the desired conversion strategy. Each metadata standard corresponds to a specific strategy.

    >>> from soso.main import convert
    >>> r = convert(file='metadata.xml', strategy='eml')
    >>> r
    '{"@context": {"@vocab": "https://schema.org/", "prov": "http://www. ...}'

Some SOSO properties may not be derived from metadata records alone. In such cases, additional information can be provided via `kwargs` and handled through method overrides.

    >>> from soso.strategies.eml import EML  # import the strategy
    >>> def get_url(self):                   # define a new method
    ...     return self.kwargs['url']
    >>> EML.get_url = get_url                # override the method
    >>> r = convert(file='metadata.xml', strategy='eml', url='https://www.sample-data-repository.org/dataset/472032')  # use kwargs
    >>> r
    '{"@context": {"@vocab": "https://schema.org/", "prov": "http://www. ...}'
