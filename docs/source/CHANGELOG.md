# Release History

## Release Process and Guidelines

This project follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) for releases. This helps us maintain an orderly progression to the project while maintaining compatibility and providing necessary bug fixes and improvements.

*Major Releases*: A major release introduces significant changes, including those that break compatibility with previous versions. These releases are identified with a version number in the format of `X.0.0`. For instance, if the previous release was `1.2.7`, the next major version will be labeled as `2.0.0`.

*Minor Releases*: A minor release does not include breaking changes and primarily focuses on bug fixes and improvements. If the previous version of soso was `1.2.7`, a minor release would be denoted as `1.3.0`.

*Patch Releases*: A patch release exclusively addresses any missed bugs from the previous version. If the previous release of soso was `1.2.7`, a patch release would be identified as `1.2.8`.
